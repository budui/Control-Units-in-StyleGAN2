# Control-Units-in-StyleGAN2

[Project](https://wrong.wang/x/Control-Units-in-StyleGAN2/) | [Paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3474085.3475274)

The official PyTorch implementation for MM'21 paper 'Attribute-specific Control Units in StyleGAN for Fine-grained Image Manipulation'


We are planning to publish a detailed tutorial on how to use it in a few days.

Take a look first:

```bash
# Download pretrained StyleGAN2 model: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EM87UquaoQmk17Q8d5kYIAHqu0dkYqdT/view?usp=sharing
# And put it in ./pretrained
# Run this command and then see the editing result in ./tmp
python3 manipulation.py test ./pretrained/modifications/before_alter_Black_Hair_12.mdfc --max_factor 20
```

# Pretrained Models

Please download the pre-trained models from the following link
